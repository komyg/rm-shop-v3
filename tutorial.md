# Part 3: Adding Unit Tests

This is a three part tutorial series in which we will build a simple shopping cart app using React and [Apollo Graphql](https://www.apollographql.com/):

- [Part 1: Retrieve and display data from a remote server.](https://dev.to/komyg/creating-an-app-using-react-and-apollo-graphql-1ine)
- [Part 2: Use Apollo to manage the app's local state.](https://dev.to/komyg/use-apollo-to-manage-the-app-s-local-state-167f)
- Part 3: Add unit tests.

On this third part we will add unit tests to our components and our resolvers.

This tutorial builds on top of the code generated in the Part 2. [You can get it here](https://github.com/komyg/rm-shop-v2).

The complete code for the Part 3 is available in [this repository](https://github.com/komyg/rm-shop-v3).

>Note: this tutorial assumes that you have a working knowledge of React and Typescript.
